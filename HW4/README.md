# Homework #4: Refactoring and Documenting Code
## DSE 511 - Fall 2025

For this assignment, I chose option A: Refactor my own code from Homework #3 (EDA).

Learning Objectives
By completing this assignment, you will:

Practice restructuring code into modular functions.

Write clear documentation (comments/docstrings) for functions and scripts.

Add simple tests (assertions, print checks, or unit tests) to confirm correctness.

Reflect on the benefits of code hygiene for usability and collaboration.

The Task
Step 1: Choose Your Starting Code
Option A: Refactor your own code from Homework #2 (Data Wrangling) or Homework #3 (EDA).  You can also ask permission to refactor something you worked on previously.

Option B: Use the short messy Python script provided on Canvas.

You may use Python, R, or C++ â€” whichever you are most comfortable with.

Step 2: Refactor
Break code into at least two functions with clear names.

Add comments or docstrings explaining what each function does and what the inputs/outputs are.

Replace duplicated code with loops or helper functions where possible.

Step 3: Add Tests
Include at least two test cases to show your functions work as intended.

Examples: use assert statements, simple print checks, or equivalent in R/C++: exception handling is optional, but you should at least test two instances where things might go wrong (e.g., empty input, wrong data type, etc.)

### Step 4: 

The original code can be accessed on HW3/notebooks/Homework3.ipynb, and it can be observed that while the code is simple, and well documented, similar to any code, could always be improved. 


Things I changed, and what they looked like before:

The changes performed both improved readability or maintainability by ...

By making the functions cleaner and easier to understand, it makes the code more acccessible to a wider audience, as well as making it easier for someone in case they need to mantain the code.
