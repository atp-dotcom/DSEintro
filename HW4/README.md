# Homework #4: Refactoring and Documenting Code
## DSE 511 - Fall 2025

For this assignment, I chose option A: Refactor my own code from Homework #3 (EDA).

The original code can be accessed on HW3/notebooks/Homework3.ipynb, and it can be observed that while the code is simple, and well documented, similar to any code, could always be improved. 

The changes performed both improved readability or maintainability by documenting the code well, and making sure the functions were optimized, and making them more readable. By making the functions cleaner and easier to understand, it makes the code more acccessible to a wider audience, as well as making it easier for someone in case they need to mantain the code.
