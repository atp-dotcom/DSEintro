# Assignment #6: Fairness in AI
## DSE 511 - Fall 2025

This repository contains the code and (README.md) file, under the /Fairness-in-AI folder.


In AI, fairness and performance often pull in opposite directions. Models optimized purely foraccuracy can inadvertently amplify biases present in training data, disadvantaging certain areas. For example, a credit-scoring or hiring algorithm may predict outcomes effectively whilereproducing historical inequities. Mitigating these biases through algorithms, reweighting, or adversarial de-biasing can reduce traditional performance metrics, highlighting the inherent trade-off.

The balance depends on context: For example, in high-stakes domains like healthcare or criminal justice, fairness may take priority, while in safety-critical or real-time systems, performance constraints limit intervention. Emerging approaches such as multi-objective optimization, causal fairness modeling, and continuous bias auditing aim to minimize the trade-off, showing that equity and effectiveness can coexist with careful design. Transparent reporting and ongoing monitoring are essential to ensure AI models serve both accurately and fairly while still maintaining both fairness and performance.
